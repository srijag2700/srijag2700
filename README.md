### Hello! 👋

My name is **Srija Gottiparthi** (she/her/hers). I'm a **junior** at **Rutgers University** (graduating May 2022), double majoring in **Business Analytics & Information Technology** (known as **BAIT**), and **Computer Science**.  

In **Summer 2021**, I'll be joining **JPMorgan Chase** in New York City as a **Software Engineering Intern**!  

Besides that, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** at **American Express** in New York City, on their **Cloud Engineering** team in **Summer 2020**.

I'm also the **Vice President & Events Coordinator** of **Rutgers USACS**, the largest Computer Science student organization at Rutgers,
