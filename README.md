### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Srija Gottiparthi** (she/her/hers). I'm a **senior** at **Rutgers University** (graduating May 2022), double majoring in **Business Analytics & Information Technology** (known as **BAIT**), and **Computer Science**.  

After I graduate in May, I will be joining **Asana** as a Software Engineer!

Most recently, in **Summer 2021**, I interned at **JPMorgan Chase** in New York City as a **Software Engineering Intern**, under **Digital Technology** in the **Consumer & Community Banking** line of business. Specifically, I worked on the **Chase Android app!**

Besides that, in **Summer 2020** I was a **Software Engineering Intern** at **American Express** in New York City, on the **Cloud Engineering** team.  
I also hold a part-time job on campus with **Rutgers Office of Information Technology** as a **Consultant**, working both in-person and remotely to assist students, faculty, and staff with technical issues related to Rutgers tools and systems.

Outside of school and work, I'm the **Vice President & Events Coordinator** of **Rutgers USACS**, the largest Computer Science student organization at Rutgers, and I'm a **Marketing Director** for **HackRU**, Rutgers' biannual student-run hackathon.

I'm interested in **software engineering, product management, AI/ML, mobile development, and data science**!
