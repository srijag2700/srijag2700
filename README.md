### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Srija Gottiparthi** (she/her/hers). I'm a **junior** at **Rutgers University** (graduating May 2022), double majoring in **Business Analytics & Information Technology** (known as **BAIT**), and **Computer Science**.  

In summer 2020, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** at **American Express**, on their **Cloud Engineering** team.  

I'm also the **Vice President & Events Coordinator** of **Rutgers USACS**, the largest Computer Science student organization at Rutgers,  
and I'm a **Marketing Director** for **HackRU**, Rutgers' biannual student-run hackathon.

I'm interested in **Software Engineering, Project/Product Management, and Data Science roles**, and am currently looking for a **Summer 2021 internship** in any of these fields.  

:inbox_tray: I can be reached on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srija-g/). Please mention in your connection request that you're coming from my Github!
