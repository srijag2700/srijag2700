### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Srija Gottiparthi** (she/her/hers). I'm a **junior** at **Rutgers University** (graduating May 2022), double majoring in **Business Analytics & Information Technology** (known as **BAIT**), and **Computer Science**.  

Right now, I'm a **Software Engineering Intern** at **American Express**, on their **Cloud Engineering** team.  

I'm also on the **Executive Board** of **Rutgers USACS**, which is the largest Computer Science student organization at Rutgers,  
and I'm a **Marketing Director** for **HackRU**, Rutgers' biannual student-run hackathon.

I'm interested in **Software Engineering, Project/Product Management, and Data Science roles**, and am currently looking for a **Summer 2021 internship** in any of these fields.
